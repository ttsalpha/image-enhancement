## Image Enhancement By Edge-Preserving Filters

> Original paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/413625

### Abstract

Image enhancement is useful when the details in an image are lost due to various reasons. It is common to subtract a
mask from a given image to enhance the details. The trick is how to obtain a good mask. We describe here how an
edge-preserving filter can be used to generate a mask which is smooth over areas with fine details, yet preserving most
of the edges. Experiments with real images show that our scheme is very effective.
